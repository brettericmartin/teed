## 1. Executive Summary

### The Opportunity

The creator economy has reached $33 billion in market value (2025), with brands increasing creator marketing budgets by 171% year-over-year. Yet a critical infrastructure gap persists: **there is no single source of truth for product information that serves both brands AND creators**.

Brands struggle to track how creators use their products. Creators waste hours hunting for accurate product specs, images, and affiliate links. Teed is uniquely positioned to solve both problems by becoming the **canonical product reference layer** between brands and creators.

### The Vision

**Teed Brand Partnerships** transforms Teed from a creator utility into essential B2B infrastructure - the "Shopify of product information" for the creator economy. Brands maintain verified product catalogs on Teed. When creators build bags (gear collections), they pull from these canonical sources, ensuring accuracy while giving brands unprecedented visibility into organic product usage.

### Strategic Fit

This opportunity aligns with Teed's core identity:
- **Canonical reference utility** - Teed already aims to be the authoritative source for gear information
- **Infrastructure, not destination** - Brand catalogs make Teed more valuable as plumbing, not a competing platform
- **Creator empowerment** - Accurate product data and auto-affiliate links increase creator independence

### Financial Summary

| Metric | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Brand Partners | 25 | 100 | 300 |
| Annual Recurring Revenue | $150K | $900K | $3.6M |
| Gross Margin | 85% | 88% | 90% |

## 2. Problem Statement

### 2.1 The Brand Problem

**Challenge: Invisible Organic Usage**

When creators organically feature products in their content, brands have zero visibility:

- **No tracking**: Brands don't know which creators use their products authentically
- **No attribution**: Organic mentions drive sales but can't be measured
- **No control**: Product information across creator content is often inaccurate or outdated
- **No discovery**: Brands can't find creators who genuinely love their products

**Current Workarounds**

| Solution | Limitation |
|----------|------------|
| **Influencer Marketing Platforms** (GRIN, CreatorIQ) | Expensive ($10K-$30K/year), focused on paid campaigns, not organic usage |
| **Google Alerts** | Manual, misses most content, no structured data |
| **Direct Outreach** | Doesn't scale, misses authentic users |
| **Affiliate Networks** | Only tracks purchases, not product features |

**The Pain Point**

> "We spend $2M annually on influencer campaigns, but our best brand ambassadors are creators who organically use our gear and we don't even know they exist." - Marketing Director, Major Outdoor Brand

### 2.2 The Creator Problem

**Challenge: Product Information Hell**

Creators waste significant time on product data management:

- **Spec hunting**: Hours spent finding accurate product specifications
- **Image sourcing**: Searching for high-quality, approved product photos
- **Link management**: Maintaining affiliate links across multiple posts and platforms
- **Outdated information**: Product names, prices, and availability change constantly
- **Compliance risk**: Using incorrect product claims or unauthorized images

**Current Pain Points**

| Task | Time Wasted Weekly | Creator Frustration |
|------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Finding accurate specs | 2-4 hours | "Every brand website is different" |
| Sourcing approved images | 1-2 hours | "Am I even allowed to use this?" |
| Managing affiliate links | 2-3 hours | "Links break constantly" |
| Verifying product names | 1 hour | "Is it the 'Pro' or 'Pro Plus' model?" |
| Updating old content | 1-2 hours | "I can't update 50 YouTube descriptions" |

**The Pain Point**

> "I spend more time researching product details than actually creating content. Every brand has different specs formats, different affiliate programs, and I never know if I have the current information." - Golf Content Creator

### 2.3 The Market Gap

**No One Owns the Product Information Layer**

Current ecosystem participants each serve partial needs:

| Player | What They Do | What They Miss |
|--------|--------------|----------------|
| **Shopify** | E-commerce infrastructure | Creator content, organic tracking |
| **Affiliate Networks** | Commission tracking | Product information, brand discovery |
| **Influencer Platforms** | Campaign management | Organic usage, canonical data |
| **PIM Systems** (Salsify, Akeneo) | Product data management | Creator interface, usage tracking |

**Teed's Unique Position**

Teed sits at the intersection of:
1. **Product information** - Structured, canonical product data
2. **Creator workflows** - Where creators build and share gear collections
3. **Distribution touchpoints** - Embeds, exports, and shares across platforms

This creates a natural "watering hole" where brands can meet creators organically.

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**One-Click Import**

When a creator selects a verified product:
1. Official product data auto-populates
2. High-res images attached
3. Affiliate links auto-configured
4. Specifications pre-filled

The creator can still add:
- Personal notes ("My go-to for cold weather camping")
- Custom photos (their own product photos)
- Usage context

### 5.2 Auto-Affiliate Linking

**How It Works**

1. Brand sets up affiliate program in their dashboard
2. Creator has their affiliate IDs in their Teed settings
3. When creator adds brand product, affiliate link auto-generates
4. Link includes both brand attribution and creator tracking

**Affiliate Link Priority**

```
Priority Chain:
1. Creator's own affiliate ID (if they have one)
2. Brand's default affiliate link
3. Teed platform affiliate (if neither above)
```

**Creator Affiliate Dashboard**

Creators see their affiliate performance:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐

**Privacy Controls**

Creators control their visibility:

| Setting | Options |
|---------|---------|
| Profile visibility | Public / Private / Brand-only |
| Contact preferences | Open / Through Teed / None |
| Usage analytics | Share with brands / Keep private |
| Follower counts | Show / Hide |

### 5.4 Independence Preservation

**Critical Design Principle**

This feature MUST increase creator independence, not decrease it.

**How We Protect Creator Independence**

1. **No lock-in**: Creators can still add custom products (not just verified)
2. **Portable data**: Export all bag data anytime
3. **Optional participation**: Verified catalogs are optional, not required
4. **Creator-first affiliate**: Creator's affiliate ID takes priority
5. **Privacy by default**: Creators opt-in to brand visibility

);
```

### 7.3 Catalog Sync Integrations

**Shopify Integration**

```typescript
// lib/integrations/shopify/ShopifyCatalogSync.ts

interface ShopifySyncConfig {
  shopifyDomain: string;
  accessToken: string;
  brandId: string;
}

class ShopifyCatalogSync {
  async syncProducts(config: ShopifySyncConfig): Promise<SyncResult> {
    // 1. Fetch products from Shopify Admin API
    const products = await this.fetchShopifyProducts(config);

    // 2. Transform to Teed product format
    const teedProducts = products.map(this.transformProduct);

    // 3. Upsert to brand_products table
    const result = await this.upsertProducts(config.brandId, teedProducts);

    return result;
  }

  private transformProduct(shopifyProduct: ShopifyProduct): BrandProduct {
    return {
      external_id: shopifyProduct.id.toString(),
      sku: shopifyProduct.variants[0]?.sku,
      name: shopifyProduct.title,
      description: shopifyProduct.body_html,
      images: shopifyProduct.images.map(img => ({
        url: img.src,
        alt: img.alt,
        primary: img.position === 1
      })),
      msrp: parseFloat(shopifyProduct.variants[0]?.price || '0'),
      // ... additional mapping
    };
  }
}
```

**CSV Import**

```typescript
// lib/integrations/csv/CSVCatalogImport.ts

interface CSVColumn {
  header: string;
  mapped_to: keyof BrandProduct;
  transform?: (value: string) => any;
}

const DEFAULT_MAPPINGS: CSVColumn[] = [
  { header: 'SKU', mapped_to: 'sku' },
  { header: 'Product Name', mapped_to: 'name' },
  { header: 'Description', mapped_to: 'description' },
  { header: 'Price', mapped_to: 'msrp', transform: parseFloat },
  { header: 'Image URL', mapped_to: 'images', transform: (url) => [{ url, primary: true }] },
  // ...
];
```

**API Integration**

```typescript
// app/api/brands/[brandId]/products/route.ts

// POST /api/brands/:brandId/products - Create/update products
// GET /api/brands/:brandId/products - List products
// PATCH /api/brands/:brandId/products/:productId - Update product
// DELETE /api/brands/:brandId/products/:productId - Remove product
```

### 7.4 Usage Tracking

**Automatic Usage Tracking**

When a creator adds a brand product to their bag:

```typescript
// lib/hooks/useAddItemToBag.ts

async function addItemToBag(bagId: string, item: NewBagItem) {
  // 1. Create bag_item
  const bagItem = await createBagItem(bagId, item);

  // 2. If from verified brand catalog, track usage
  if (item.brand_product_id) {
    await trackProductUsage({
      brand_product_id: item.brand_product_id,
      bag_item_id: bagItem.id,
      creator_id: currentUser.id,
    });
  }

  return bagItem;
}
```

**Analytics Aggregation**

Hourly cron job aggregates usage data:

```sql
-- Update daily brand analytics
INSERT INTO brand_analytics (brand_id, date, products_featured, unique_creators, total_bags)
SELECT
  bp.brand_id,
  CURRENT_DATE,
  COUNT(DISTINCT pu.brand_product_id),
  COUNT(DISTINCT pu.creator_id),
  COUNT(DISTINCT bi.bag_id)
FROM product_usage pu
JOIN brand_products bp ON pu.brand_product_id = bp.id
JOIN bag_items bi ON pu.bag_item_id = bi.id
WHERE pu.added_at >= CURRENT_DATE
GROUP BY bp.brand_id
ON CONFLICT (brand_id, date)
DO UPDATE SET
  products_featured = EXCLUDED.products_featured,
  unique_creators = EXCLUDED.unique_creators,
  total_bags = EXCLUDED.total_bags;
```

---

## 9. Success Metrics

### 9.1 North Star Metric

**Primary: Monthly Active Brand Products**

Products from verified catalogs that appear in at least one creator bag each month.

Why this metric:
- Shows brands getting value (their products are being used)
- Shows creators finding verified catalogs useful
- Correlates with retention and expansion

### 9.2 Leading Indicators

| Metric | Target (Year 1) | Measurement |
|--------|-----------------|-------------|
| Brand activation rate | > 80% | % of brands with > 10 products in catalog within 30 days |
| Creator adoption rate | > 25% | % of active creators using verified products |
| Product sync health | > 95% | % of brand products successfully synced |
| Time to first usage | < 14 days | Days from brand onboarding to first creator usage |

### 9.3 Lagging Indicators

| Metric | Target (Year 1) | Measurement |
|--------|-----------------|-------------|
| Net Revenue Retention | > 110% | Revenue from existing customers YoY |
| Logo Churn | < 15% | % of brands churned annually |
| CAC Payback | < 12 months | Months to recover customer acquisition cost |
| LTV:CAC Ratio | > 3:1 | Customer lifetime value vs. acquisition cost |

### 9.4 Health Metrics

**Brand Health Score**

```
Brand Health = (
  Catalog Completeness × 0.2 +
  Login Frequency × 0.2 +
  Creator Usage × 0.3 +
  Feature Adoption × 0.15 +
  Support Tickets × 0.15
)
```

| Score | Status | Action |
|-------|--------|--------|
| 80-100 | Healthy | Expansion opportunity |
| 60-79 | At Risk | Proactive check-in |
| 40-59 | Unhealthy | Intervention required |
| < 40 | Critical | Executive escalation |

---

## 10. Risk Assessment

### 10.1 Strategic Risks

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| **Brands don't see value** | Medium | High | Focus on pilot success, iterate on analytics |
| **Creators reject brand presence** | Low | High | Maintain creator-first design, privacy controls |
| **Competitors copy feature** | High | Medium | Move fast, build relationships, deepen integration |
| **Economic downturn cuts marketing budgets** | Medium | High | Emphasize ROI, flexible pricing |

### 10.2 Execution Risks

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| **Technical complexity underestimated** | Medium | Medium | Phased rollout, start simple |
| **Sales cycle longer than expected** | High | Medium | Build pipeline early, nurture leads |
| **Support burden overwhelming** | Medium | Medium | Self-serve tools, documentation |
| **Integration issues with Shopify/others** | Medium | Low | Partner early, test thoroughly |

### 10.3 Market Risks

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| **Creator economy contracts** | Low | High | Diversify value prop beyond creators |
| **Platform changes (TikTok ban, etc.)** | Medium | Medium | Platform-agnostic positioning |
| **Privacy regulations limit tracking** | Medium | Medium | Privacy-first architecture |

### 10.4 Risk Response Plan

**If brand adoption is slow:**
1. Offer free tier for first 50 brands
2. Create case studies from early adopters
3. Partner with industry influencers for validation

**If creators reject the feature:**
1. Make all brand features opt-in
2. Emphasize creator benefits (auto-affiliate, accuracy)
3. Add more privacy controls

---

## 11. Legal Considerations

### 11.1 FTC Compliance

**Disclosure Requirements**

Per [FTC Guidelines](https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/resources/disclosures-101-social-media-influencers), both brands AND creators are responsible for proper disclosure.

**Teed's Role:**

1. **Automatic disclosure support** - When bags contain affiliate links from brand catalogs, disclosure language auto-appears
2. **Brand responsibility messaging** - Brands agree to FTC compliance in terms
3. **Creator education** - Help resources on disclosure requirements

**Implementation:**

```typescript
// When displaying bags with brand products + affiliate links
const disclosureRequired = bagHasAffiliateLinks(bag);
if (disclosureRequired) {
  displayDisclosure("This collection contains affiliate links. The creator may earn a commission on purchases.");
}
```

### 11.2 Data Privacy

**Creator Data Shared with Brands**

| Data | Shared | Creator Control |
|------|--------|-----------------|
| Username/handle | Optional | Opt-in |
| Follower count | Optional | Opt-in |
| Bags/items | If public | Bag privacy setting |
| Contact info | Never | N/A |
| Earnings | Never | N/A |

**Brand Data Protection**

- Brand pricing and product data protected
- Aggregate analytics shared, not raw data
- Competitor brands cannot see each other's creator lists

**GDPR / CCPA Compliance**

- Data processing agreements with brands
- User consent for tracking
- Data deletion upon request
- Clear privacy policy

### 11.3 Terms & Agreements

**Brand Partner Agreement**

Key terms:
- Acceptable use of creator data
- Prohibition on direct scraping
- Affiliate link requirements
- FTC compliance acknowledgment
- Termination and data handling

**Creator Terms Update**

Additions needed:
- Consent to brand visibility (opt-in)
- Affiliate link disclosure requirements
- Data sharing preferences

### 11.4 Intellectual Property

**Brand Content**

- Brands own their product data and images
- License to Teed for platform display
- Creator usage rights defined by brand

**Creator Content**

- Creators own their bags, notes, and custom content
- Brands cannot claim creator content
- Clear attribution requirements

---

## 12. Advisory Board Evaluation

Using the evaluation framework from ADVISORS.md:

### Daniel Priestley Score: 9/10

**7/11/4 Amplification**
- Brand products appear across creator content (multiple touchpoints)
- Verified catalogs work 24/7 without brand effort
- Usage data creates visible demand signals

**Demand/Supply Tension**
- Limited verified brands creates exclusivity
- "Your competitors are already here" narrative
- Waitlist for premium tiers

**Campaign-Driven Opportunity**
- Quarterly "Brand Partnership" launch campaigns
- Industry-specific waves (outdoor season, golf season)
- Creates buzz and FOMO among brands

**Verdict: APPROVED**
> "This creates a system where brands can collect signals of interest (creator usage) before asking for commitment (paid campaigns). It's the 7-11-4 rule for B2B - brands get multiple touchpoints with creators through the platform."

### Julie Zhuo Score: 8/10

**Simplicity**
- Creator experience: One-click to add verified product
- Brand experience: Connect Shopify, see analytics

**Progressive Disclosure**
- Basic: See products in catalog
- Intermediate: Analytics dashboard
- Advanced: Creator outreach, API access

**Native Feel**
- Verified badge feels native to product cards
- Brand portal feels like natural extension

**Improvement Needed:** Brand onboarding could be simpler - consider Shopify-only launch.

**Verdict: APPROVED**
> "The creator experience is clean - they just see better products with a verified badge. The brand side has appropriate complexity for B2B."

### Li Jin Score: 7/10

**Creator Independence**
- Creators GAIN: Accurate data, auto-affiliate links
- Creators KEEP: Control over what to feature, privacy settings
- Concern: Does brand visibility pressure creators?

**Platform Risk**
- This makes Teed MORE valuable to creators (better data)
- Doesn't increase creator dependency on specific platforms

**Ownership**
- Creators still own their bags and content
- Can export data anytime
- Can use custom products (not forced to use verified)

**Improvement Needed:** Ensure brand outreach is always opt-in for creators.

**Verdict: NEEDS WORK**
> "The core concept increases creator capability, but we need strong privacy defaults. Brands should never see a creator without the creator explicitly opting in."

### Emily Heyward Score: 9/10

**Premium Positioning**
- "Verified by Brand" badge elevates credibility
- B2B portal has professional, premium feel
- Not discount-driven - value-driven

**Brand Language**
- "Brand Partnership Program" not "Brand Advertising"
- "Verified Catalogs" not "Brand Listings"
- "Creator Discovery" not "Influencer Targeting"

**Emotional Connection**
- Brands feel pride seeing organic usage
- Creators feel trust with verified data
- Mutual respect vs. transactional

**Verdict: APPROVED**
> "The positioning is right. This isn't about brands buying creators - it's about brands earning credibility by having great products that creators choose organically."

### Codie Sanchez Score: 10/10

**Infrastructure Play**
- Teed becomes the "Shopify of product information" for creators
- Works regardless of which creator or brand wins
- Revenue from infrastructure, not competing with users

**Boring Reliability**
- Brands pay monthly whether creators feature them or not
- Recurring revenue with high retention
- Not dependent on viral moments

**Picks & Shovels**
- Enables brands AND creators
- Takes a cut for providing the infrastructure
- Doesn't compete - facilitates

**Cash Flow**
- Predictable monthly recurring revenue
- High gross margins (85%+)
- Low variable costs

**Verdict: APPROVED**
> "This is the picks-and-shovels play for creator commerce. Brands need infrastructure to participate in the creator economy. Teed becomes essential plumbing - boring, reliable, profitable."

### Board Decision: 4/5 APPROVAL

**Ship with Li Jin's improvements:**
1. Privacy-first defaults (creators opt-in to brand visibility)
2. Clear "Creator Protection" messaging
3. Brands cannot contact creators without consent

## Specialist Perspective Synthesis

### General User Specialist Priorities
- **Photo-first entry** - Upload photos, AI identifies products
- **Minimal effort** - Quick workflows, smart questions only when needed
- **Simple sharing** - Links and QR codes for friends/family
- **Discovery** - Find similar setups, get inspired
- **Privacy control** - Public/private options

**Key Insight:** Generic users want AI to do the work, not be the focus.

### AI Specialist Priorities
- **Intelligent automation** - Product identification, enrichment, matching
- **Smart question generation** - Context-aware prompts for incomplete data
- **Catalog integration** - Match user items to verified products
- **Learning systems** - Improve from user corrections
- **Multi-modal input** - Photos, text, voice, transcripts

**Key Insight:** AI should be invisible infrastructure, not a feature showcase.

### Influencer Specialist Priorities
- **Speed & automation** - Bulk operations, auto-link generation
- **Affiliate monetization** - Multi-network support, earnings tracking
- **Analytics transparency** - Detailed performance metrics
- **Multi-platform distribution** - One bag, many sharing options
- **Mobile-first** - Full functionality on mobile devices

**Key Insight:** Influencers need power tools, but they should feel simple.

### Minimal Specialist Priorities
- **Simplicity** - Clean UI, minimal features, reduced friction
- **Fast onboarding** - Get started in seconds, not minutes
- **Progressive disclosure** - Show only what's needed, when needed
- **No feature bloat** - Every feature must earn its place
- **Intuitive design** - Self-explanatory, no tutorials needed

**Key Insight:** Less is more - complexity should be optional, not default.

### Tension Points & Resolutions

| Tension | Resolution Strategy |
|---------|-------------------|
| **Generic users want simple** vs **Influencers need advanced features** | Progressive disclosure: Simple defaults, advanced features hidden until needed |
| **AI should be powerful** vs **UI should be minimal** | AI as infrastructure: AI powers features invisibly, UI stays clean |
| **Influencers need analytics** vs **Generic users want privacy** | Tiered analytics: Basic (views) for all, detailed (clicks/earnings) for influencers |
| **Photo-first for generic** vs **Transcript-first for influencers** | Multiple entry paths: All methods available, but default based on user type |
| **Minimal wants fewer features** vs **Influencers need comprehensive tools** | Feature flags: Core features for all, influencer features opt-in |

## The Board

### Daniel Priestley — Growth, Leverage & Demand Generation
**Background**: Entrepreneur, author of *Oversubscribed*, *Key Person of Influence*, *24 Assets*, and *Scorecard Marketing*. Founder of Dent Global (one of the world's top business accelerators). Co-founder of ScoreApp (serving 150,000+ businesses). Has built and sold multiple companies across industries.

**Sources**: [The Futur](https://www.thefutur.com/content/have-people-lining-up-to-do-business-with-you), [Brand & Market](https://brandandmarket.co/blog/from-0-to-trust-how-to-implement-the-7-11-4-rule-in-your-brand-ecosystem/), [ScoreApp](https://www.scoreapp.com/videos/lead-generation-scorecard-marketing/), [Daniel Priestley on X](https://x.com/DanielPriestley/status/1950179577071898676)

#### The 7-11-4 Rule
Before someone trusts you enough to buy, they need:
- **7 hours** of interaction with your brand (research shows ~7 hours moves strangers to friends)
- **11 touchpoints** of engagement (Google research on purchase decisions)
- **4 separate locations** or media channels (social, long-form, owned, physical)

This means: podcasts, YouTube videos, blog posts, social media, email, in-person—all working together to build familiarity and trust.

#### The 24 Assets Framework
Every business needs 24 marketing assets across 7 categories working 24/7:
1. **Intellectual Property**: Content, Methodology, Registered IP
2. **Brand**: Philosophy, Identity, Ambassadors
3. **Market**: Positioning, Channels, Data
4. **Product**: Gifts, Product-for-Prospects, Core Product, Products-for-Clients
5. **System**: Processes, Technology, Automation
6. **Culture**: Team, Values, Environment
7. **Funding**: Revenue streams, Investment, Reserves

**Core Belief**: "Income follows assets because assets are the machine that generates income and leverage."

#### Demand/Supply Tension & Being Oversubscribed

**The core insight**: Most businesses chase customers one-by-one. Oversubscribed businesses create visible demand that exceeds supply, then release access strategically.

> "The key to becoming an oversubscribed business is to market for signals first - not sales. Build up demand and supply tension, and only where there are enough bubbles behind the cork, do you pop the top off." — Daniel Priestley

**How demand/supply tension works**:
- Create an official capacity (how many can you truly delight?)
- Make sure people know what that capacity is
- Collect signals of interest, not immediate sales
- Only release when demand visibly exceeds supply
- The transparency of scarcity creates urgency without manipulation

**Example language**: "We've got 40 clients that we can work with in a year. We've got 300-400 people who have filled in the assessment. We pick and choose. Can we interview you to see whether you'd be suitable?"

#### The Campaign-Driven Enterprise Model

Daniel's 5-phase model for generating demand rhythmically (not hoping for trickle):

| Phase | Focus | Key Action |
|-------|-------|------------|
| **1. Planning** | Capacity | Know exactly how many you can delight—that's your ceiling |
| **2. Build-up** | Signaling | Signal to market what's coming; get them to signal back interest |
| **3. Release** | Staged access | Release when oversubscribed, in tiers (early bird, VIP, general) |
| **4. Remarkable delivery** | Exceed expectations | Under-promise, over-deliver to create stories |
| **5. Celebrate & innovate** | Momentum | Share success publicly, analyze data, reward team, rest |

**Why campaigns beat constant selling**:
- Many people engage at once → creates synergistic buzz
- Avoids boredom and burnout of one-to-one pursuit
- Creates natural rhythm and anticipation
- Each campaign builds on the last

#### Signaling & Scorecard Marketing

**The problem**: You can't sell to people who haven't signaled interest. But asking for a sale too early kills the relationship.

**The solution**: Create low-friction ways for people to signal interest while receiving value.

**Scorecards/Assessments**:
- Give instant gratification (a score, insights, personalized results)
- Collect valuable data about each person
- Signal interest without pressure to buy
- Create community through shared participation
- Turn dormant desires into active ones

**Active vs. Dormant Desires**:
- **Active desires**: People already looking to buy (small pool, high competition)
- **Dormant desires**: People who could be activated (huge pool, low competition)

> "Great brands manufacture dormant desires." — Daniel Priestley

**Everything is downstream from lead generation**: If you can't capture attention and generate signals of interest, nothing else matters.

#### Teed Lens
- Does this feature help creators multiply touchpoints across 4+ locations?
- Does this make bags work as "authority catalogs" that work 24/7?
- Does this create assets that compound value over time?
- Does this reduce the hours needed to build trust?
- **Does this create a signal of interest before asking for commitment?**
- **Does this build visible demand/supply tension?**
- **Does this turn one interaction into 7 hours / 11 touchpoints / 4 locations?**

#### Questions Daniel Would Ask
1. "How does this help a creator get found across more touchpoints?"
2. "Does this asset work when the creator isn't actively promoting?"
3. "Will this compound over time or require constant maintenance?"
4. "Can one piece of content become multiple touchpoints automatically?"
5. "Does this build trust faster or slower than alternatives?"
6. **"What's the signal of interest before commitment here?"**
7. **"Is there visible demand/supply tension, or invisible hope?"**
8. **"Are we running campaign rhythms or hoping for organic trickle?"**
9. **"Does this help creators collect signals, not just broadcast content?"**

### Julie Zhuo — Product & Design
**Background**: Former VP of Design at Facebook (14 years, intern to VP). Author of *The Making of a Manager*. Co-founder of Sundial. Joined Facebook when it had fewer than 100 employees.

**Sources**: [Intercom Blog](https://www.intercom.com/blog/podcasts/podcast-julie-zhuo-on-product-design/), [Design Better Podcast](https://designbetterpodcast.com/p/rewind-julie-zhuo), [Medium](https://joulee.medium.com/)

#### Core Design Principles

**"Strong design principles should be controversial"**
Good principles explain why YOUR company made a decision that another wouldn't. If everyone agrees with your principle, it's not distinctive enough.

**"Data tells you what is happening, but not why"**
While data is critical, she warns: "Really big, innovative, step-function ideas aren't going to come out of data. They require a leap of faith and creativity."

**"Teams should really own the problem"**
She gets concerned when teams are in 100% agreement—that suggests they're not getting the discourse and debate that makes products better.

**User-Centric Iteration**
Great design starts with understanding user needs through real engagement, research, and continuous iteration based on feedback.

**Collaboration Across Disciplines**
UX doesn't exist in isolation. Strong partnerships between designers, engineers, and product managers create cohesive products.

#### Teed Lens
- Does this feel like "hanging work in a gallery" (premium, intentional)?
- Is there a simple path AND an advanced path (progressive disclosure)?
- Does it feel discovered, not disrupted (native to context)?
- Would both power users and new users feel respected?
- Can users preview exactly what something looks like before committing?

#### Questions Julie Would Ask
1. "What's the simplest version that still delivers value?"
2. "Does this feel native to where it appears, or like an intrusion?"
3. "Are we getting enough debate about this approach?"
4. "What does data tell us vs. what requires creative intuition?"
5. "How will this evolve based on user feedback?"

### Li Jin — Creator Economy & Ownership
**Background**: Former a16z partner. Co-founder of Variant Fund. Founder of Atelier Ventures. Coined "The Passion Economy" in influential 2019 essay. Known as "the godmother of the passion economy."

**Sources**: [Andrew Chen](https://andrewchen.com/passion-economy/), [Li Jin's site](https://li-jin.co/), [NFX](https://www.nfx.com/post/li-jin-passion-attention-economy), [Mirror](https://li.mirror.xyz/Rgk2La8izmn5LaqAlRHne-N2g0CaAxWdaSXW8KE8-Ag)

#### The Passion Economy Framework

**"Individuality as a feature, not a bug"**
Unlike gig economy platforms that commoditize workers, passion economy platforms let creators monetize their unique skills, knowledge, and personality.

**Marketplace vs. SaaS distinction**:
- **Marketplaces**: Offer discovery but creators depend on platform traffic
- **SaaS platforms**: Require creators to drive own audience but enable independence (can export subscriber lists, own customer relationships)
- Established creators prefer SaaS models; emerging creators benefit from marketplace discoverability

**Ownership comes in different forms**:
- Owning a neutral channel of communication (email lists, RSS subscribers)
- Owning the direct monetization relationship (Stripe account)
- Owning your domain and self-hosted content
- Owning data, relationships, content, and identity

**"Platforms should provide holistic tools to grow and operate a business"**
Not just matching supply and demand—marketing features, coaching, regulatory support. Platforms monetizing through creator success become incentivized to help creators thrive.

#### Teed Lens
- Does this give creators more control and leverage, or less?
- Does this reduce platform dependency and risk?
- Does attribution flow correctly (creator first, Teed subtle)?
- Does this help creators own their audience relationship?
- Can creators take their data/audience if they leave?

#### Questions Li Would Ask
1. "If TikTok/YouTube/Instagram changes tomorrow, does this still work?"
2. "Who gets credit when this is shared—the creator or Teed?"
3. "Does this consolidate the creator's power or fragment it?"
4. "Are we helping creators own their audience, or intermediating?"
5. "Does this work for emerging AND established creators?"

### Emily Heyward — Brand & Language
**Background**: Co-founder and Chief Brand Officer at Red Antler. Author of *Obsessed: Building a Brand People Love from Day One* (2020 Porchlight Marketing Book of the Year). Built brands for Casper, Allbirds, Boxed, Keeps, Burrow. Also works with American Express, HBO, Google, Gap.

**Sources**: [TechCrunch interview](https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/24/red-antlers-emily-heyward-explains-how-to-get-people-obsessed-with-your-brand/), [How Brands Are Built](https://howbrandsarebuilt.com/podcast/emily-heyward/), [Aloa](https://aloa.co/blog/startup-branding-101-ten-takeaways-from-emily-heywards-book-obsessed)

#### Core Brand Principles

**"Brand Early, Not Often"**
Red Antler's philosophy directly contradicts "lean startup" approaches. Invest in brand before product-market fit, not after. Brand is not something you create then move on—it's a living, breathing thing woven into every facet of business.

**"Ground yourself in a real problem"**
Don't confuse problems with solutions. Avoid solutions-focused language like "making it easier to..." Ask "Why does this matter?" repeatedly until answers run out—you'll find deeper human motivations: fear of vulnerability, need for achievement, desire for freedom.

**Emotion trumps function**
The most critical element is "what we want people to feel when they interact with the brand." By introducing emotional connection to functional categories, startups differentiate in crowded markets.

**Focus creates impact**
Instagram's concentration on photos while Facebook attempted everything shows how narrowed scope enables stronger storytelling.

**Embrace tension and uniqueness**
"Consistency is key" can hold companies back. Great brands embrace tension: pioneering AND lovable, luxury AND inclusivity, earnestness AND toughness, rugged AND goofy.

**Dismiss data bias in branding**
"Data can tell you the answer of what your brand should stand for"—and that's the problem. Data-driven brand approaches risk creating forgettable, safe brands.

#### Teed Lens
- Is the visual language muted, earthy, premium (room to breathe)?
- Does the copy build authority or sound desperate/needy?
- Would a creator be proud to show this branding, or try to hide it?
- Are we solving a real problem, or describing a solution?
- Does this create emotional connection, not just functional value?

#### Questions Emily Would Ask
1. "Would this look at home in a premium editorial context?"
2. "Is the language assertive or needy? Confident or anxious?"
3. "Would a creator pay extra to KEEP this branding visible?"
4. "What do we want people to FEEL when they see this?"
5. "Are we being focused, or trying to do everything?"

### Codie Sanchez — Cash Flow, Infrastructure & Contrarian Value
**Background**: Former Wall Street executive (15 years). Founder of Contrarian Thinking and Unconventional Acquisitions. NYT bestselling author of *Main Street Millionaire*. Owns 26+ businesses. Estimated net worth $17.7M, portfolio revenues $4.1M/month. Mission: Create 1 million financially free humans through business ownership.

**Sources**: [Contrarian Thinking](https://www.contrarianthinking.co), [WarTime CEO Stories](https://wartimeceostories.com/p/the-magic-of-contrarian-thinking-codie-sanchez), [James Altucher Show](https://jamesaltuchershow.com/episode/how-to-build-wealth-buying-boring-businesses-codie-sanchez), [Inc Magazine](https://www.inc.com/tim-crino/how-to-turn-boring-businesses-into-cashflow-machines/90990137)

#### Core Philosophy

**"The best business school is being in business"**
Experience over degrees. Betting on yourself over building someone else's dream. Practical entrepreneurship over theoretical frameworks.

**Main Street Over Wall Street**
High-risk tech ventures get all the attention, but local service-based businesses offer stability that mainstream markets cannot. "Boring businesses" like laundromats, car washes, and landscaping are the backbone of economic activity.

**The "Boring Business" Advantage**:
- Minimal competition (nobody glamorizes them)
- Loyal, recurring customer bases
- Consistent cash flows
- Weather economic downturns better
- Untapped potential waiting to be unlocked

**Cash Flow is King**
Multiple streams of income that generate money regardless of market conditions. Profitability over growth-at-all-costs.

#### The "Picks and Shovels" Infrastructure Thesis

The most powerful version of Codie's philosophy: **sell infrastructure to an industry, not products within it.**

**Origin**: During the California Gold Rush, Samuel Brannan became the first millionaire—not by mining gold, but by selling picks, shovels, and pans to miners. The merchants who sold essential supplies often made more money than the miners themselves.

**Why infrastructure wins**:

| Direct Play | Infrastructure Play |
|-------------|---------------------|
| Bet on which creator/company wins | Enable ALL creators/companies |
| High variance, winner-take-all | Revenue regardless of who succeeds |
| Compete with the product | Profit from the competition |
| Single customer success | Industry-wide adoption |

**Modern examples**:
- **Shopify** → Powers billions in transactions, takes a cut from every sale regardless of which store wins
- **ASML** → Makes the machines that make the chips—doesn't need to pick AI winners
- **Stripe** → Infrastructure for internet payments, wins when ANY online business wins
- **AWS** → Powers Netflix, Airbnb, Slack—doesn't compete with them, enables them

**The infrastructure advantage**:
- Sign long-term contracts, serve multiple customers
- Generate revenue today rather than betting on future adoption
- Reduce risk because infrastructure profits regardless of which end-products succeed
- Diversification built-in: if one customer fails, others continue

**Contrarian Thinking Framework**:
- Question assumptions everyone accepts
- Seek hidden value where others see risk or tedium
- Make decisions based on logic rather than trends
- Look beyond the hype to consistent cash flow
- Build the layer that enables others, not the layer that competes with them

**Strategic Leadership Over Daily Operations**
Delegate operations to competent managers. Focus on scaling and transformation, not micromanaging.

**Customer Experience as Competitive Edge**
Simple amenities (WiFi, comfortable seating) can transform mundane businesses into community hubs, converting casual visitors into repeat patrons.

#### Teed Lens
- Does this create consistent, reliable value (not just hype)?
- Is this the "boring" approach that actually works?
- Does this generate ongoing returns without constant maintenance?
- Are we being contrarian in a valuable way, or just different?
- Does this compound over time like a cash-flowing asset?
- **Does this make Teed essential infrastructure, not a destination?**
- **Does this work regardless of which platform or creator wins?**
- **Are we selling picks and shovels, or trying to mine gold ourselves?**

#### Questions Codie Would Ask
1. "What's the boring, reliable version of this that nobody's building?"
2. "Does this generate consistent value or require constant input?"
3. "Are we chasing trends or building durable infrastructure?"
4. "Would a practical businessperson invest in this feature?"
5. "Does this serve the creator who wants steady income, not viral fame?"
6. **"Is this infrastructure that enables others, or a product competing with them?"**
7. **"Would this still be valuable if TikTok, YouTube, or Instagram disappeared?"**
8. **"Are we the Shopify/Stripe of creator references—essential plumbing everyone needs?"**

## What you can see now

Every Teed creator has a stats page at `/u/yourhandle/stats`. It's been there for a while — showing views, clicks, and a few highlights about how people interact with your collections.

Today we're expanding what that page shows you, and adding deeper metrics to individual bag analytics too.

## New on your stats page

### Profile views

You can now see how many people visited your profile page. Not just your bags — your actual profile. This helps you understand how visible you are beyond any single collection.

### Social link clicks

If you've added social links to your profile (Instagram, YouTube, Twitter, TikTok), you'll see a breakdown of how many people clicked each one. This is useful for understanding which platforms your Teed audience gravitates toward.

### Bag shares

When someone shares one of your bags — via the share button, copying the link, or using native share — that's now tracked and shown in your stats. Shares are one of the strongest signals that your curation is genuinely useful to people.

### Follower count

Your follower count and new followers within the selected time period are now visible in the Profile & Social section.

## New per-bag metrics

When you open analytics on any individual bag (from the bag editor), you'll now see three new metrics alongside views, visitors, and clicks:

- **Saves** — how many people bookmarked your bag for later
- **Clones** — how many people were inspired enough to create their own version
- **Shares** — how many times this specific bag was shared

These only appear when there's data, so your analytics view stays clean.

## Why this matters

The original stats page was designed around a simple question: are people finding your stuff? Views and clicks answered that.

But creators kept asking things like: "Are people actually saving my bags?" "Do my social links get clicked?" "Is my profile getting traffic or just individual bags?"

These are questions about *reach* and *engagement* beyond the basic funnel. The new metrics answer them without adding noise — they only show up when they have something meaningful to say.

## What we track (and don't)

Everything on your stats page is aggregated and anonymous. You see counts, not individual users. We don't track who specifically viewed your profile or which user saved your bag — just that it happened.

Your stats are private. Only you can see them.

## What's next

This is the foundation. We're looking at time-series views (how your stats change day by day), comparison periods ("up 40% from last month"), and eventually email digests so you don't have to check manually.

For now, go check your stats page. You might be surprised how far your curations have traveled.

## Two bags in one

Ryder Rivadeneyra makes golf content. That means he needs two completely different sets of gear: the stuff he uses to play golf, and the stuff he uses to film golf. Most platforms would force him to split these into separate lists — camera gear in one place, golf gear in another. But that's not how he actually carries or thinks about his equipment.

His bag on Teed has 21 items that span both worlds. Clubs next to cameras. A rangefinder near a lens. It's a crossover bag, and it represents a type of setup that's becoming increasingly common but rarely gets documented properly.

## The golf content creator boom

Golf content on YouTube and social media has exploded in the last few years. Creators like Good Good, Rick Shiels, and dozens of smaller channels have built audiences by filming themselves and their friends playing golf. The production values keep climbing. What started as tripod-on-the-tee-box footage has evolved into multi-camera, drone-assisted, professionally edited content.

This creates a specific gear problem. A golf content creator needs to be two things simultaneously: a competent golfer with real equipment, and a competent videographer with real production gear. The two skill sets overlap in zero ways, but the gear has to coexist in the same car, the same golf cart, sometimes the same bag.

Ryder's 21-item collection captures this duality better than any gear list I've seen.

## What makes it interesting

The golf side of Ryder's bag is functional and intentional. These are clubs and accessories chosen by someone who plays the game seriously, not props for content. You can tell the difference — a prop setup looks like it was bought for a thumbnail. A real setup has the wear patterns and specific configurations of someone who actually plays rounds with this gear.

The filming side is equally purposeful. The camera and lens choices are optimized for outdoor shooting — golf courses present specific challenges with bright sun, distant subjects, and fast-moving objects (golf balls travel at 150+ mph off the tee). You need a lens that can reach the green from behind the tee box. You need a camera body that handles harsh daylight without blowing out the sky. You need stabilization because you're walking and shooting on uneven terrain.

Seeing both sides together reveals the compromises. Weight matters when you're carrying all of this for 18 holes. Size matters when it has to fit in or around a golf bag. Durability matters because golf courses aren't gentle on equipment — grass, sand, moisture, the occasional errant golf ball.

## The platform problem

Try documenting a setup like this on any single-category platform and you immediately hit walls. A golf gear site doesn't have categories for camera equipment. A photography platform doesn't know what a 56-degree wedge is. Amazon wishlists would turn it into an undifferentiated list of 21 products with no relationship to each other.

Teed bags are category-agnostic by design. A bag is just a curated collection of things. Those things can be golf clubs, cameras, lenses, filters, and accessories all in the same container. Sections let you organize by purpose — golf gear in one section, filming gear in another — while keeping everything together in a single shareable URL.

This matters because the bag reflects how Ryder actually uses this stuff. He doesn't have a "golf life" and a "content creation life." He has one workflow that requires both, and the bag mirrors that reality.

## More crossovers ahead

Ryder's bag is one example, but crossover setups are everywhere. A musician who also streams needs instruments *and* broadcasting gear. A chef who creates recipes for social media needs kitchen tools *and* camera equipment. A fitness influencer needs gym gear *and* production tech.

The most interesting bags on Teed might end up being the ones that refuse to stay in a single lane. They're harder to categorize, but they're more honest about how people actually use their gear. The real world doesn't have clean category boundaries. Your bag shouldn't have to either.

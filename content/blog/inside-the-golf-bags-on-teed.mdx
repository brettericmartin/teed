## Golfers are obsessive, and that's a compliment

If you've ever watched a golfer pull out their phone to show you the specs on their new wedges — bounce angle, grind type, shaft flex — you already understand WITB culture. "What's In The Bag" isn't just a question. It's a genre. There are entire YouTube channels, Reddit threads, and forum wars dedicated to it.

Golf is, by a wide margin, the most popular category on Teed. That wasn't the plan. But it makes perfect sense. A golf bag is already a curated collection. Fourteen clubs, each chosen for a reason, each filling a specific slot. Golfers don't just buy equipment — they *build setups*. And they want to show them off.

## The bags

We've got a growing collection of golf bags on the platform, and looking across them reveals some interesting patterns.

<BagEmbed handle="teed" code="mattyyy-s-golf-bag" />

**Mattyyy's Golf Bag** is the biggest on Teed at 29 items. That number alone tells you something — this isn't just clubs. It's the full picture: bag, rangefinder, gloves, towels, headcovers, accessories. Most WITB content stops at the 14 clubs. Mattyyy's bag captures the stuff that actually lives in the bag, the things you'd dump out on the garage floor if someone asked to see everything.

**WesleyGolfs** and **Matt Scharff** both run 19-item setups that lean more traditional. These are golfers who know their games and have settled into configurations that work. You don't see a lot of experimentation in their bags — it's refined, deliberate. The kind of bag that doesn't change much season to season.

**Sean Walsh's Break 50 Bag** at 14 items is interesting for a different reason. The name tells the whole story. This is a golfer working toward a specific goal, and the bag is built around that ambition. It's tighter, more focused. Every club has to earn its spot when you're chasing a score.

**David Kushner's WITB** rounds things out at 13 items — clean, minimal, no fluff.

## What patterns emerge

Looking across these bags, a few things stand out.

**TaylorMade and Titleist dominate.** This won't surprise anyone who follows golf, but it's stark when you see it visually. Drivers and woods skew TaylorMade. Irons and wedges skew Titleist. Scotty Cameron putters show up more than any other single brand in any single club slot.

**The accessories tell the real story.** Clubs are interesting, but the accessories reveal personality. Rangefinder brand, headcover style, what kind of divot tool someone carries — this is where bags start to feel personal rather than formulaic. Mattyyy's 29 items capture this better than any WITB video because everything gets its own card with context.

**Content creators carry more.** The bags from golf content creators tend to be bigger. Partly because they test more equipment, partly because they want to show a complete setup. Amateur bags are tighter, more utilitarian. Neither approach is wrong, but the difference is real.

## Why WITB works as a bag

The reason golfers took to Teed so quickly is that a bag is already the natural metaphor. You don't have to explain the concept. A golfer intuitively understands that this is a curated set of items, organized by purpose, that represents their choices.

What Teed adds is permanence and shareability. A WITB video is great, but it's frozen in time and buried in a YouTube feed. A bag on Teed is a living document. Swap out your driver? Update the bag. Add a new wedge? It's reflected immediately. And the URL never changes — you can drop it in your Instagram bio, your forum signature, or a group chat, and it always points to your current setup.

## The meta-bag

One of my favorite bags on the platform is **Coolest Golf Bags** — a collection of golf bags themselves. It's a bag of bags. A curated list of the best-looking golf bags (the physical bag, not the Teed collection), which is such a perfectly golfer thing to care about. Because of course the bag your clubs go in matters. Of course it does.

## What's next

Golf will keep being the heart of Teed's content for a while, and that's fine. The WITB format is a natural fit, and golfers are among the most detail-oriented gear communities out there. If you play and you haven't built your bag yet, you probably should. The URL alone is worth it — better than explaining your setup in a group chat for the twentieth time.

## The WITB problem

You post a What's In The Bag photo on Instagram. Maybe it gets some likes, a few comments asking about your putter. A week later, it's buried under vacation photos and swing videos. Gone.

Or you list your clubs in your Reddit flair, where you get 30 characters to describe fourteen clubs, a bag, and accessories. Nobody's learning anything from "TM Stealth / Apex / Spider."

Your golf bag setup is something people genuinely want to know about — playing partners, forum friends, anyone considering the same clubs. It deserves a permanent home, not a disappearing story.

## What a good golf bag page looks like

The best WITB pages share a few things:

- **Organized by club type.** Driver, fairway woods, hybrids, irons, wedges, putter, bag and accessories. People scan for the category they care about.
- **Photos of your actual clubs.** Not stock images. Your gamer with the wear marks and the headcover you actually use.
- **Context on each pick.** Not just "TaylorMade Stealth 2 Driver" but why. The shaft you chose. What you switched from. Whether you'd buy it again.
- **Links to where people can buy them.** If someone sees your wedge setup and wants the same grind, give them a direct path.

## Building your golf bag on Teed

Here's the actual process, start to finish.

**1. Create your bag.** Sign up at [teed.so](https://teed.so) and create a new bag. Name it something like "My Golf Bag 2025" or "Current WITB." Pick a cover photo — a clean shot of your bag or your setup on the practice green works well.

**2. Set up sections.** Organize your bag the way golfers think about clubs:

- Driver
- Fairway Woods & Hybrids
- Irons
- Wedges
- Putter
- Bag & Accessories

Sections are drag-and-drop, so you can reorder them later if you change your mind.

**3. Add your clubs.** For each club, you have a few options:

- **Type the name.** Start typing "TaylorMade Stealth" and the search will pull up matching products with photos and details.
- **Snap a photo.** This is the fast path. Take a photo of a club, upload it, and the AI identification will figure out the brand and model. It works surprisingly well with golf equipment — it can tell a Stealth from a Stealth 2, a Vokey SM9 from an SM10.
- **Paste a link.** Drop a URL from any golf retailer and Teed will pull in the product details automatically.
- **Bulk import.** If you have links to all your clubs already (from a previous order history, for example), paste them all at once.

**4. Add your notes.** This is what separates a good WITB page from a plain equipment list. For each item, use the "Why I chose this" field. Share the real story:

- "Switched from the SIM2. Gained about 5 yards but mainly wanted the lower spin."
- "46/50/54/58 setup. The 50 is the most versatile club in my bag."
- "Third putter this year. This one's staying."

**5. Add specs and details.** Shaft type, flex, length, grip — the details that golfers actually ask about. Add them to each item's specs so people can see your exact configuration.

**6. Share it.** Your bag gets a permanent URL like `teed.so/u/yourname/witb-2025`. Drop it in your Instagram bio, your GolfWRX forum signature, your group chat. Anyone can view it without signing up — it just loads as a clean, fast page.

## Keeping it updated

The big advantage over a one-time Instagram post: your bag page is alive. Swap out a wedge? Update that one item. Change putters (again)? Edit and it's current. You keep one URL forever, even as your bag evolves through the season.

You can also export your bag contents for YouTube video descriptions or newsletter shoutouts if you create golf content.

## Why golfers share their bags

Golf is an equipment sport. Every course conversation eventually turns to "what are you hitting?" and "how do you like that?" Having a permanent page for your setup means you can answer that question once and point everyone to it.

No story that expires. No spreadsheet to email. Just a URL with your whole bag, organized, photographed, and annotated with the context that makes it actually useful to other golfers.

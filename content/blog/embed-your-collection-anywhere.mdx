## Why embed instead of just linking

A link sends people away from your site. An embed keeps them on it.

If you're a photographer with a portfolio site, you want visitors to see your gear page right there — between your gallery and your contact form. If you're a golf blogger reviewing a course, embedding your current bag setup adds context without making readers leave.

Embeds turn your Teed collection into a component that lives wherever you need it.

## How Teed embeds work

Every public bag on Teed has an embed option. The basic setup:

**1. Find your embed code.** On your bag page, look for the embed or share option. You'll get a snippet that looks like a standard embed code — a small block of HTML you can paste into any webpage.

**2. Paste it into your site.** Drop the embed code into the HTML of your page, blog post, or content editor. The collection renders inline, matching the width of its container.

**3. It stays current.** The embed pulls live data from your Teed bag. When you update an item, add a new one, or rearrange sections, the embedded version reflects those changes automatically. No need to regenerate or re-paste code.

## Platform-specific setup

### WordPress

In the WordPress block editor (Gutenberg), add a Custom HTML block and paste your embed code. In the classic editor, switch to the Text tab and paste it wherever you want the collection to appear. Most WordPress themes handle embeds without any extra configuration.

### Squarespace

Use a Code Block in any page section. Paste the embed code and save. Squarespace renders it inline within your page layout.

### Ghost

Ghost supports HTML cards in its editor. Add an HTML card, paste the embed code, and it renders in your published post. Works in both Ghost Pro and self-hosted setups.

### Personal sites and static site generators

If you're running a personal site built with HTML, a static site generator like Hugo or Astro, or a React-based framework — paste the embed code directly into your HTML or template. It works anywhere that renders standard HTML.

### Notion and Medium

Teed supports oEmbed, which means platforms that support rich link previews can render your bag inline. Paste your bag URL into Notion or Medium and it should generate a preview card. The richness of the preview depends on the platform's oEmbed rendering.

## RSS feeds for auto-updating content

Beyond one-time embeds, Teed provides RSS feeds for your bags and your profile. This opens up some useful automation:

**Blog sidebars.** If your blog platform supports RSS widgets, you can pull in your latest gear updates automatically. Add a new item to your bag, and it shows up in your sidebar without touching your blog's code.

**Newsletters.** Tools like Mailchimp and Buttondown can pull RSS feeds into email templates. If you update your gear regularly, subscribers can get those updates as part of your newsletter.

**Aggregation.** If you maintain collections across multiple categories, the profile-level RSS feed captures updates across all your bags in one stream.

## Export formats for content creators

Not every use case needs a live embed. Sometimes you just need a formatted text list.

**YouTube descriptions.** Export your bag as a product list formatted for video descriptions — product names with links, organized by section. Copy, paste into your description box, done. No more manually typing out every item and hunting for the right affiliate link.

**Newsletter content.** Export a formatted version for pasting into email editors. Clean product names, links, and your notes for each item.

These exports are snapshots — they capture your bag at a point in time, which is usually what you want for a video description or email that gets published once.

## Real use cases

**The photographer portfolio.** A photographer embeds their "Camera Kit" bag on their About page. Clients see the equipment, potential collaborators see the capability. When the photographer upgrades a body or adds a new lens, the embed updates automatically.

**The golf blogger.** A course review post includes an embedded bag showing the writer's current club setup. Readers can see exactly what was in the bag during the round being reviewed. The writer links to this same bag across every review, with the setup always current.

**The YouTuber setup page.** A creator's website has a dedicated "/gear" page that embeds multiple Teed bags: Studio Setup, Travel Kit, EDC. Each one stays current as gear changes. Video descriptions link to the same permanent URLs.

**The product reviewer.** A tech reviewer embeds themed collections in relevant articles — "Best Budget Home Office" or "My Actual Travel Tech" — adding credible, curated product context alongside written reviews.

## Getting started

Create a bag on [Teed](https://teed.so), add your items, and grab the embed code. One paste into your site and your collection is live. Update your bag whenever your gear changes — the embed handles the rest.

The goal is simple: your gear collection should live wherever your audience already is, not just on a separate page they have to click away to see.

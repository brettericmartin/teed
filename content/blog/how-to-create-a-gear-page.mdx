## "What camera do you use?"

If you've ever posted a photo, a video, a podcast, a song, a workout, or even a well-organized desk — someone has asked what gear you use.

It's a compliment. But answering the same question in DMs, comments, and emails gets old fast. You need a single page you can point people to. Here's what you use, here's why, here are links if you want the same thing.

That's a gear page.

## Why existing tools fall short

You've probably tried one of these:

**Notion.** Powerful for personal databases, but a Notion page full of product links doesn't look like a gear page. It looks like a project management tool. Sharing means publishing a Notion link that loads slowly and feels foreign to most visitors.

**Amazon lists.** Amazon wishlists and idea lists have no sections, no custom ordering, no notes explaining why you chose something. Plus they're plastered with "customers also bought" recommendations that dilute your curation. And if a product isn't on Amazon, it can't go on the list.

**Linktree / link-in-bio tools.** These are for links to your own content, not for showcasing products with photos, descriptions, and context. A flat list of URLs with no product images or organization isn't a gear page.

**Kit.co.** This was actually close to what people needed — and then it shut down. If you had a Kit.co page, you know the gap it left.

**Google Sheets.** Functional. Private. Ugly. Nobody's clicking a spreadsheet link and thinking "wow, nice setup."

## Building your gear page on Teed

Here's the five-minute version.

**1. Sign up and create a bag.** A "bag" on Teed is a curated collection — it works for any category of stuff, not just literal bags. Name it "My Photography Gear" or "Studio Setup" or "Home Office" or whatever fits.

**2. Add items.** You have four ways:

- **Search and add.** Type a product name and pick from results. Photos and details get pulled in automatically.
- **Paste a URL.** Drop a link from any retailer. Teed extracts the product name, image, and price.
- **Upload a photo.** Take a picture of the item and upload it. AI identification figures out what it is — brand, model, category.
- **Bulk import.** Have a bunch of product links already? Paste them all at once. Each one gets processed and added as a separate item.

**3. Organize with sections.** Group your items logically. A photography gear page might have sections for Camera Bodies, Lenses, Lighting, Audio, and Bags. A home office page might split into Desk, Display, Audio, and Peripherals. Drag items between sections or reorder them.

**4. Add context.** For each item, there's a "Why I chose this" field. This is the part that turns a product list into a recommendation. A few sentences about what you like, what you'd change, whether it's worth the price. This is what people are actually looking for when they ask about your gear.

**5. Set your cover and publish.** Pick a hero image — a flat lay of your gear, your workspace, whatever represents the collection. Your bag gets a permanent URL at `teed.so/u/yourhandle/bag-code`.

That's it. Five minutes for a page you'll use for years.

## What you can do with your gear page

**Share the URL anywhere.** Instagram bio, YouTube description, Twitter/X bio, email signature, forum signature. One link that covers "what do you use?"

**Embed it on your website.** If you have a portfolio site or blog, embed your gear page directly with a single code snippet. It renders inline — no iframe jank.

**Keep it current.** Swap a lens? Update one item. Your URL stays the same; the content stays fresh. People checking your page six months from now see your current setup, not a stale list.

**Export for content.** Creating a YouTube video or newsletter? Export your bag as a formatted product list ready for a video description or email.

## Who this is for

- **Photographers** who get asked about cameras and lenses weekly
- **Musicians** who want to share their pedalboard, studio setup, or live rig
- **Gamers** who've built a setup worth showing off
- **Fitness people** with a gym bag or home gym worth recommending
- **Desk setup enthusiasts** — you know who you are
- **Anyone** who's tired of typing out the same gear list in DMs

If people ask what you use, you need a gear page. It takes five minutes to make one that lasts.

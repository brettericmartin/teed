## The problem with lists

Lists never end. They grow sideways, accumulate cruft, and eventually collapse under their own weight. Every productivity app knows this — and every user has felt the quiet dread of opening a list that's gotten away from them.

When we started building Teed, we asked a simple question: **what if your collection had edges?**

## A bag is a commitment

A physical bag forces choices. You can't fit everything, so you choose what matters. That constraint isn't a limitation — it's the entire point. It's what turns a random pile of stuff into a *curated set*.

Teed bags work the same way. They're not infinite scroll. They're not wishlists. They're a deliberate collection of things you've chosen, organized the way you want, and shared on your terms.

## What this means in practice

When you create a bag on Teed, you're making a statement:

- **These are the things I actually use.** Not aspirational, not saved-for-later — real.
- **The organization matters.** Sections, order, and grouping reflect how you think about your gear.
- **It's finished enough to share.** A bag isn't a draft. It's a curated snapshot.

## Curation over accumulation

The internet has a hoarding problem. Bookmarks pile up. Wishlists grow unchecked. Pinboards become graveyards.

Teed takes the opposite approach. We believe that **less, but better** is more useful — to you and to anyone discovering your collection.

A bag with 12 carefully chosen items tells a richer story than a list with 200.

## The shareable part

The real power of bags is that they're built to be shared. Your bag page is a clean, fast, permanent URL. No login required. No algorithm deciding who sees it.

When someone lands on your bag, they see exactly what you intended — your gear, your way, with context only you can provide.

That's the philosophy. Bags, not lists. Edges, not infinity. Curation, not accumulation.

# Teed — Real-World Product Context from Curators
# https://teed.club

## What Teed Provides
Teed is a **product context source**. When users ask about a product, Teed provides what AI shopping agents can't: why a real person chose it, what they pair it with, and what they considered instead.

Every item on Teed includes:
- **why_chosen**: A first-person explanation of why the creator picked this product
- **compared_to**: What they compared it against before deciding
- **alternatives**: Other products they considered
- **paired items**: What else is in their bag (setup/kit/collection)

## Who Uses Teed
Creators across categories curate their real setups:
- Golfers sharing complete bag configurations
- Photographers documenting camera kits
- Tech creators with desk setups
- Travelers with vetted packing lists
- Musicians cataloging instruments and pedals
- Fitness enthusiasts with gym equipment
